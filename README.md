# babel-tricks
A couple of node projects to show the various config options of babel e.g. using a .babelrc file or using a babel.config.js file

Exploring what various plugins actually do rather than just using the default presets env.

# Overview

clone the repo

cd to the project folders e.g. babel-tricks-rc

```npm install```

```npm run-script build```

It's watching for file changes, so the build process does not terminate

Open another terminal:

```npm start```
